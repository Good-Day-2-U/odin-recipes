Secondly it couldn't be more simple. And thirdly, well it basically tastes like a chocolate coffee milkshake but it gets you drunk. What could be better than that?! The perfect cocktail to cap off a perfect evening.

    The White Russian is a twist on the Black Russian (it becomes white with added cream) and seems to have been invented some time in the 1960's. However the drinks popularity skyrocketed in the 90's when it was featured in the Coen brothers film, The Big Lebowski, as the titular Dude's drink of choice. Whether you've seen the movie or not though we can gurantee you're going to love this drink.
